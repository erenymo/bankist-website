## What is Bankist?

Bankist is a fictional online bank. It is a project introduced by <a href="https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann">Jonas Schmedtmann</a> in order to practice DOM manipulation and user interaction. It has tons of array methods and real-world best practices. Bankist has an option to log in to the account and use different functionalities, almost like in an actual bank! (This Bankist website is designed to learn JavaScript functionalities, So, I didn't focus on responsive design.)
